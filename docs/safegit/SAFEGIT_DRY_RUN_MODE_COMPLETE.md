# SafeGIT Dry-Run Mode - Implementation Complete

**Related Code Files:**
- `safegit.py` - Main SafeGIT wrapper with dry-run mode implementation
- `safe_git_commands.py` - Core safety commands (already had dry-run support)

---

## Overview

I've successfully implemented comprehensive dry-run mode for SafeGIT. Users can now simulate any git command to see what would happen without actually executing it. This is invaluable for understanding the impact of dangerous operations before committing to them.

## Implementation Details

### Command Line Usage

```bash
safegit --dry-run <any git command>
```

The `--dry-run` flag can be added to ANY safegit command to simulate execution.

### Key Features

1. **Global Dry-Run Flag**
   - Added `self.dry_run` attribute to SafeGitWrapper class
   - Flag is parsed at the beginning of the run() method
   - Removed from args before processing to avoid conflicts

2. **Enhanced _run_git_command()**
   - Intercepts all git executions in dry-run mode
   - Shows the exact command that would be executed
   - Calls `_explain_command_effects()` to describe what would happen

3. **Command Effect Explanations**
   - New method `_explain_command_effects()` provides detailed explanations
   - Covers all major git commands with specific effect descriptions
   - Shows different effects based on flags (--hard vs --keep, -d vs -x, etc.)

### Handler-Specific Dry-Run Support

1. **Reset Handler** (`_handle_reset_hard`)
   ```
   🔍 DRY-RUN: Showing what would happen:
      • Would reset to: HEAD~1
      • Would affect: 3 file(s)
      • Total changes that would be lost: 150 lines
   ```

2. **Clean Handler** (`_handle_clean_force`)
   ```
   🔍 DRY-RUN: Showing what would happen:
      • Would delete: 12 file(s)
      • Total size: 2.3 MB
      
      File categories that would be deleted:
      • logs_temp: 8 files
      • build_artifacts: 4 files
   ```

3. **Checkout Handler** (`_handle_checkout_force`)
   ```
   🔍 DRY-RUN: Showing what would happen:
      • Would discard changes in: 5 file(s)
      
      Files with changes that would be lost:
      M  src/main/java/MyClass.java
      M  README.md
      ... and 3 more
   ```

4. **Push Force Handler** (`_handle_push_force`)
   ```
   🔍 DRY-RUN: Showing what would happen:
      • Would force push branch: feature-branch
      • ⚠️  Local and remote have diverged!
      • Would overwrite remote commits
   ```

5. **Generic Dangerous Handler**
   - Covers rebase, branch delete, commit amend, stash drop, etc.
   - Provides operation-specific warnings and recovery information

6. **Context Commands**
   - Dry-run support for set-env, set-mode, add/remove-restriction
   - Shows what context changes would be made

### Example Usage

```bash
# See what a hard reset would do
safegit --dry-run reset --hard HEAD~3

# Check what files would be cleaned
safegit --dry-run clean -fdx

# Preview force push implications
safegit --dry-run push --force origin main

# Test context changes
safegit --dry-run set-env production

# Simulate rebase
safegit --dry-run rebase -i HEAD~5

# Preview branch deletion
safegit --dry-run branch -D old-feature
```

### Output Format

All dry-run outputs follow a consistent format:

1. **Header**: "🔍 DRY-RUN MODE: Simulating command without executing"
2. **Command Display**: Shows exact git command that would run
3. **Effects**: Lists specific effects of the operation
4. **Warnings**: Highlights risks and potential data loss
5. **SafeGIT Actions**: Explains what SafeGIT would do in real execution

### Benefits

1. **Risk-Free Learning**: Users can explore dangerous commands safely
2. **Impact Assessment**: See exactly what would be affected before executing
3. **Confidence Building**: Understand SafeGIT's protections without triggering them
4. **Debugging**: Verify command construction and safety checks
5. **Documentation**: Dry-run output serves as inline documentation

### Integration with Existing Features

- Works with all SafeGIT safety checks
- Shows file counts, change statistics, and risk assessments
- Explains SafeGIT interventions (backups, stashes, conversions)
- Compatible with context restrictions and modes

## Testing Recommendations

Test dry-run mode with various scenarios:

```bash
# Test with uncommitted changes
echo "test" >> file.txt
safegit --dry-run reset --hard HEAD

# Test with untracked files
touch new_file.txt
safegit --dry-run clean -fdx

# Test on protected branch
git checkout main
safegit --dry-run push --force

# Test with complex commands
safegit --dry-run rebase -i --autosquash HEAD~10
```

## Summary

The dry-run mode implementation is complete and fully integrated across all SafeGIT commands. Users can now safely explore and understand the impact of any git operation before executing it. This feature significantly enhances SafeGIT's educational value while maintaining its protective capabilities.
