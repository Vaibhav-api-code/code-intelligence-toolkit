# Organize Files Tool - Atomic Operations Enhancement Summary

**Related Code Files:**
- `organize_files.py` - Enhanced file organization tool with atomic operations and retry logic
- `safe_move.py` - SafeMover class with atomic file operations and enhanced error handling

---

## Enhanced Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Atomic Move Operations with Retry Logic

**New Capabilities:**
- Uses `_enhanced_atomic_move()` from `safe_move.py` for truly atomic operations
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed operations
- Temporary file staging with atomic replacement using `Path.replace()`
- Enhanced error handling with specific exception types

**Configuration Options:**
```bash
--max-retries 5           # Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
--retry-delay 1.0         # Initial delay between retries (default: 0.5s)
--operation-timeout 60    # Timeout per operation (default: 30s)
```

### 2. File Lock Detection and Handling

**New Capabilities:**
- Detects when files are locked by other processes using `fcntl.flock()`
- Automatically waits for files to become unlocked with configurable timeout
- Provides detailed lock status information in verbose mode
- Tracks locked file statistics separately

**Configuration Options:**
```bash
--wait-for-unlock 20      # Wait up to 20 seconds for locked files (default: 10s)
```

**Enhanced Output:**
```
‚è≥ File document.pdf is locked, waiting up to 10s...
‚úÖ File document.pdf unlocked, proceeding...
üîí Locked files encountered: 2
```

### 3. Checksum Verification for Data Integrity

**New Capabilities:**
- Optional MD5 checksum verification for all moved files
- Ensures data integrity during file operations
- Automatic cleanup on checksum failures
- Tracks checksum failure statistics

**Configuration Options:**
```bash
--verify-checksum         # Enable checksum verification
--no-verify-checksum      # Explicitly disable (faster but less safe)
```

**Enhanced Output:**
```
‚úì Checksum verified for document.pdf
‚ö†Ô∏è Checksum verification failures: 1
```

### 4. Manifest/Rollback Safety with Atomic Updates

**New Capabilities:**
- Atomic manifest file updates using temporary files
- Incremental manifest updates during long operations
- Enhanced manifest format with configuration and statistics
- Thread-safe manifest operations with global locks
- Temporary manifest files for progress tracking

**Enhanced Manifest Format:**
```json
{
  "created": "2025-07-20T23:17:34.244671",
  "total_operations": 3,
  "operations": [...],
  "configuration": {
    "max_retries": 3,
    "retry_delay": 0.5,
    "operation_timeout": 30,
    "verify_checksum": true,
    "wait_for_unlock": 10
  },
  "stats": {
    "moved": 3,
    "skipped": 0,
    "errors": 0,
    "locked_files": 0,
    "checksum_failures": 0
  }
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Reporting

**New Statistics Tracked:**
- Locked files encountered
- Checksum verification failures
- Operation timeouts
- Retry attempts and successes

**Enhanced Error Messages:**
- Specific error types (FileLockError, ChecksumMismatchError, FileOperationError)
- Detailed lock status information
- Operation-specific error context
- Configuration summary in verbose mode

### 6. Environment Variable Support

**All options configurable via environment variables:**
```bash
export ORGANIZE_FILES_MAX_RETRIES=5
export ORGANIZE_FILES_RETRY_DELAY=1.0
export ORGANIZE_FILES_TIMEOUT=60
export ORGANIZE_FILES_VERIFY_CHECKSUM=true
export ORGANIZE_FILES_CONCURRENT=8
export ORGANIZE_FILES_WAIT_UNLOCK=20
```

### 7. Bulk Operation Optimization

**New Capabilities:**
- Concurrent operation control for bulk file processing
- Progress tracking with incremental manifest updates
- Efficient bulk operation statistics
- Optimized memory usage for large file sets

**Configuration Options:**
```bash
--concurrent-operations 8  # Maximum concurrent operations (default: 4)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Organization with Enhanced Safety
```bash
# Organize by extension with checksum verification and retry logic
./organize_files.py ~/Downloads --by-ext --verify-checksum --max-retries 5

# Organize by date with manifest creation and enhanced error handling
./organize_files.py ~/Documents --by-date "%Y-%m" --create-manifest --verbose

# Archive old files with atomic operations and timeout control
./organize_files.py /tmp --archive-by-date 30 --operation-timeout 60
```

### Dry Run with Configuration Preview
```bash
# Preview operations with full configuration display
./organize_files.py ~/Downloads --by-ext --dry-run --verbose --verify-checksum
```

### Undo Operations
```bash
# Undo with enhanced manifest information
./organize_files.py --undo-manifest organization_manifest_20250720_231734.json --verbose
```

## Implementation Details

### Thread Safety
- Global manifest lock (`_MANIFEST_LOCK`) for atomic manifest updates
- Thread-safe statistics tracking
- Concurrent operation control with limits

### Error Handling Hierarchy
1. **FileLockError** - File locked by another process
2. **ChecksumMismatchError** - Data integrity verification failed
3. **FileOperationError** - General file operation failure
4. **Exception** - Unexpected errors with graceful handling

### Atomic Operation Flow
1. Check file lock status and wait if necessary
2. Calculate source checksum (if verification enabled)
3. Create unique temporary file name with timestamp
4. Copy to temporary location with timeout protection
5. Verify checksum of temporary copy
6. Atomically replace destination with `Path.replace()`
7. Remove original source file
8. Update manifest incrementally
9. Clean up on any failure

### Retry Logic
- Exponential backoff: `retry_delay * (2 ** attempt)`
- Maximum retry attempts configurable
- Detailed retry attempt logging
- Different retry strategies for different error types

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing command-line options work unchanged
- Default behavior remains the same unless new options are used
- Environment variables provide optional enhanced configuration
- Manifest format is enhanced but still compatible with undo operations

## Testing Performed

1. **Basic functionality** - Verified file organization works as before
2. **Atomic operations** - Tested with checksum verification
3. **Retry logic** - Simulated file lock scenarios
4. **Manifest creation/undo** - Full cycle testing
5. **Error handling** - Various failure scenarios
6. **Configuration options** - All new command-line arguments
7. **Environment variables** - Configuration via environment

The enhanced `organize_files.py` tool now provides enterprise-grade file organization capabilities with atomic operations, comprehensive error handling, and full rollback support while maintaining complete backward compatibility.
