# AST Context Feature Test Results

**Test Date**: January 9, 2025

## Summary

Successfully implemented AST context support across 10 Python tools in the code-intelligence-toolkit directory. The implementation adds the `--ast-context` flag to each tool, which shows hierarchical context (like `TestClass(1-17) → testMethod(5-11)`) for each result line.

## Test Results

| Tool | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **find_text_v3.py** | ✅ Success | Shows AST context for each search match in both Java and Python files |
| **dead_code_detector.py** | ✅ Success | Shows which class/method contains dead code |
| **cross_file_analysis_ast.py** | ✅ Success | Shows AST context for definitions and usages |
| **method_analyzer_ast.py** | ⚠️ Redirected | Tool redirects to v2 which doesn't have the feature yet |
| **find_references_rg.py** | ✅ Success | Shows AST context for each reference found |
| **analyze_unused_methods_rg.py** | ✅ Success | Shows AST context for unused methods |
| **navigate.py** | ✅ Success | Shows AST context when navigating to code locations |
| **trace_calls.py** | ✅ Success | Shows AST context in call trees |
| **analyze_internal_usage.py** | ✅ Success | Shows AST context for internal method usage |
| **replace_text_ast.py** | ⚠️ Partial | Has rope library issues but AST context feature is implemented |

## Example Output

### find_text_v3.py
```
code-intelligence-toolkit/test/TestASTContext.java:
     8: [TestASTContext(6-42)]:     private int counter = 0;
    11: [TestASTContext(6-42)]:         this.counter = 1;
    18: [TestASTContext(6-42) → processData(14-20)]:         counter++;
    34: [TestASTContext(6-42) → getCounter(33-35)]:         return counter;
```

### dead_code_detector.py
```
  method: unusedPrivateMethod
    File: /path/to/TestASTContext.java:28 [TestASTContext(6-42) → unusedPrivateMethod(28-31)]
    Language: java
    Reason: Multiple usages found (2 references)
    Code: private void unusedPrivateMethod(
```

### find_references_rg.py
```
Line 14 [TestASTContext(6-42) → processData(14-20)]:
>>>   14:     public void processData(String orderId) {

Line 39 [TestASTContext(6-42) → main(37-41)]:
>>>   39:         test.processData("ORDER123");
```

## Implementation Details

All tools now use the shared `ast_context_finder.py` module, which provides:
- Efficient caching of AST parsing results
- Support for both Python (using `ast` module) and Java (using `javalang`)
- Robust Java method/class boundary detection with proper brace counting
- Structured data returns instead of string parsing

## Known Issues

1. **method_analyzer_ast.py** - The tool is redirected to v2 in run_any_python_tool.sh, but v2 doesn't have the AST context feature yet
2. **replace_text_ast.py** - Has issues with the rope library version detection, but the AST context feature is properly implemented
3. **analyze_internal_usage.py** - Only works with Java files due to its regex patterns

## Next Steps

1. Update method_analyzer_ast_v2.py with AST context support
2. Fix rope library compatibility issues in replace_text_ast.py
3. Consider extending analyze_internal_usage.py to support Python files
