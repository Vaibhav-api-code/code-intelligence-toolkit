# Phase 1 Completion Summary - Quick Wins

**Related Code Files:**
- `requirements-core.txt` - Core dependencies only
- `requirements-optional.txt` - Optional dependencies for advanced features
- `check_java_structure.py` - Renamed from check_structure.py
- `examples/data-analysis/` - Moved project-specific scripts

---

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (Completed in 15 minutes)

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Removed Project-Specific Scripts**
   - Moved `analyze_diff_time_severity.py` → examples/data-analysis/
   - Moved `analyze_nonzero_difftime.py` → examples/data-analysis/
   - Moved `check_medium_scores.py` → examples/data-analysis/
   - These domain-specific tools are now in examples, not the core toolkit

2. **Fixed Hardcoded Paths**
   - Verified `find_references_rg.py` - Already uses `.` as default scope ✓
   - Verified `analyze_dependencies_rg.py` - Already uses `.` as default scope ✓
   - Both were already fixed by the previous migration

3. **Separated Dependencies**
   - Created `requirements-core.txt` - Only 3 essential packages:
     - javalang (Java AST parsing)
     - esprima (JavaScript AST parsing)
     - psutil (System utilities)
   - Created `requirements-optional.txt` - Advanced features:
     - rope (Python refactoring)
     - numpy, pandas, sklearn (semantic_diff_v3)
     - Development and testing tools
   - Updated main `requirements.txt` to reference both files

4. **Renamed for Clarity**
   - `check_structure.py` → `check_java_structure.py`
   - Updated wrapper script references
   - Clarified description: "Validate Java source file structure and syntax"

## Impact

- **Cleaner Structure** - No project-specific tools in main directory
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Core functionality needs only 3 packages
- **Clear Purpose** - Tool names now clearly indicate their function
- **Easy Installation** - Users can choose core-only or full installation

## Ready for Phase 2

The toolkit is now cleaner and more focused. Next phases will tackle:
- Consolidating multiple versions of tools
- Standardizing argument parsing
- Adding comprehensive documentation

All Phase 1 tasks completed successfully with minimal effort!
