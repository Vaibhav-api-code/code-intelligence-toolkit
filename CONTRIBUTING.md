# Contributing to the Code Intelligence Toolkit

We welcome contributions that enhance the safety and intelligence of the toolkit. Please focus on the following principles:

## Core Principles

1. **Safety First**: All new features must prioritize safe operations.
2. **Performance**: Changes should not degrade the performance of the core tools.
3. **Clarity**: Ensure code and documentation are clear and well-tested.

## Getting Started

Please open an issue to discuss any major changes before submitting a pull request.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Code Quality**: All code must follow Python best practices and include appropriate error handling
- **Testing**: New features should include test coverage
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for any new features
- **Safety**: Any operations that could modify or delete data must have safety checks

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`)
3. Make your changes following the principles above
4. Test thoroughly with the existing test suite
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of changes

## Areas We're Especially Interested In

- Additional language support (Go, Rust, TypeScript)
- Enhanced AI reasoning capabilities
- Performance optimizations that maintain safety
- Additional safety features and protections
- Integration with more development tools

Thank you for helping make the Code Intelligence Toolkit safer and more powerful for everyone!
